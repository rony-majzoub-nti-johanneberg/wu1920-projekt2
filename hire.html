                    <p class="card-subtitle medium-text">Buratino is a centrally located theater & party room in a detached property at Munkebäckstorget. 
                        Our vision for Buratino is to create a beautiful, functional and attractive meeting place that would suit the smaller groups without sacrificing feeling, equipment and class. 
                        With a renovated original scene from the 50's. The hall is tastefully renovated in an older style with medallion wallpapers in red, green and gold.
                        <br>
                        The theater can be darkened or used with a large light penetration through windows in all weathers. 
                        The large hall is suitable for sitting table seating up to about 80-100 people sitting in front of the 'big stage. 
                        Of course, the room can accommodate more! for example, using the stage or the bar at one's table setting.
                        <br><br>
                        Buratino is equipped with full sound and light for both simpler events for advanced music or theater performances. We can also offer technology assistance to all types of events.
                        <br>
                        Buratino is suitable for events with many guests, but even smaller events and performances with 20 to 30 guests work well thanks to the flexible solution in the theater.
                        <br><br>
                        To the theater room we also have an entrance with wardrobe and toilets and a bar with seating. The property is located on the edge of a larger park and during the summer it is also possible to place business there.
                        
                        Buratino can be booked for occasional workouts, single days or at fixed times. The cost of this depends on the scope, the type of arrangement and the day of the week. Today, the venue is actively used by bands such as repairs, theater, magic shows, lectures, lessons, party rooms and the release party.</p>
